SIP library written in C#.

This library was written following the "Implementer’s Guide to Scalable and Robust Internet Telephony with Session Initiation Protocol in Client-Server and Peer-to-Peer modes in Python" written by Kundan Singh, and is heavily based upon his python library.

See the SIPLibDriver project for a very simple example.

There is no documentation at the moment.
